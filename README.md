# iwarranty-project

For now i have not add much filters and data validation and clearing logics because i was not sure which data is important and how to transform it, but i have kept the code structure in such a way that whenever we get input on how to process the data, we can easily update the code base and incorporate new validators.

To run the project,
```
npm i
npm run start
```

Currently this project is working on existing `iw-tech-test-retailer-data.xlsx` file, but you can replace this file with new data and run again.

Also At the moment its taking only Sheet 1 for input, if needed, we can improve that too.
